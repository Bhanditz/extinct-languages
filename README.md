# Language Extinction

This project will visualize The Guardian's [Extinct Languages dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/extinct-languages).

I will be also be documenting my progress, for the sake of showing how the data visualization process works.  This documentation will include design details, but will also appeal to a technical audience looking to make interactive data visualizations.

I will be using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a library for making user interfaces, along with  [d3](https://d3js.org/), a data visualization library.
